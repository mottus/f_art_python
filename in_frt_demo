FRT CONFIG FILE
VERSION 0.9
# this is the FRT configuration file in its new format
# the first line of the file has to be FRT CONFIG FILE, the second line containing
# version information (of config file, not FRT!) is currently not used. However, if
# changes will be introduced, it might be checked in the future.
# Rules are simple: a line starting with # is a comment
# Data are divided into SECTION's, general format
# SECTION <section_type> <section_name>
#  <data line1>
#  <data line2>
#  ...
# END SECTION
# input is CASE SENSITIVE: control words (like SECTION) are in uppercase, section
# type in lowercase, section names preferably in lowercase, but the same case to be
# used when referring to a section and when defining it.
# Blank lines are ignored and also spaces in the beginning of a line, so indent at
# your will. The only formally required section is frt (no name is required, the
# first section of this type is used), this section should contain referances to
# at least one treeclass SECTION, and also atmosphere, viewconfig, and undergrowth
# SECTIONs. The general rule for referring to a section is
# <datakeyword> <sectiontype> <sectionname>
# <sectiontype> also determining the type of submodel used. If no name
# is specified, the first SECTION of appropriate type is used.
# Data lines (not referring to a submodel) are generally of the format
# <datakeyword> <avg> <min> <max> <delta>
# where min, max & delta are used only when in inverse mode, or
# <datakeyword> <data1> <data2> ...
# for string & some other values (see documentation/comments for details)
# when a data file is requested, the file has to have at least 2 colums
# first column has to contain sequentially ordered wavelength
# the smallest and largest wavelengths encountered in an input file may limit the 
# range used by frt -- wavelengths beyond this range are ignored

  job_id -1                # i_job:
    # -3 : produce RAMI output
    # -2 : angular reflectance on a (thetha,phi) grid (1 wl)
    # -1 : flux reflectance (spectrum or discrete wavelengths)
    #  0 : single reflectance (one wavelength)
    #  1 : reflectance spectrum (spectrum or discrete wavelengths)
    #  2 : reflectance angular distribution (fixed azimuth, 1 wl)
    #  3 : reflectance for several Sun angles (1 wl)
    #  4,5 : inversion (1 wl)
  age 5                   # optional, not used in computations

  refr_idx file refrind.dat
    # wax refrective index, either a single value or keyword
    # 'file' followed by file name (as usual, 2-column format,
    # (wavelength, idx)
    # used in PROSPECT and Liberty

  nlayers 4               
  # no. of canopy layers (used to integrate numerically 1st order reflectance)

  treeclass ellipsoid birch1
  # in inverse mode, only 1st treeclass is optimized

  groundmodel mcrm
  # groundmodel lambert simple
  # for "groundmodel lambert <name>", reflectance value can be
  # specified instead of name, e.g., "groundmodel lambert 0.5"

  skymodel difsky
  # for "skymodel difsky <name>", S/Q ratio can be
  # specified instead of name, e.g., "skymodel difsky 0.5"

  # invmodel inversion    # inversion parameter set

  angles geometry         # view & sun angles

  wavelength spectrum  s1 # specifies which wavelengths to use.
  # If job_id uses only one wavelength, the first in spectrum
  # or a discrete block will be used. In the discrete case,
  # a single value can also be used instead of section name,
  # e.g. "wavelength discrete 550" or even "wavelength 550".

  correction_wl -2
  # The wavelength for computing the energy conservation correction of 
  # higher-order scattering to match the source by 1st-order
  # wavelength affects the used leaf R/T ratio
  # 0: use correction for each wl separately
  # negative: index in the wl array (-1: 1st wl, -2: 2nd, etc.)
  # positive: absolute wavelength to be used (find closest match)
  # to have no correction, use a very negative number,
  #    i.e., index beyond wavelength array length

  cubature GLcubature GL91
  # cubature type: GLcubature (Gauss-Lagrange) works and can be
  # specified in a separate SECTION, but you can specify the no.
  # of knots over zenith and  azimuth as 'cubature 9 9' or
  # 'cubature GLcubature 9 9'
